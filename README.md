# Activity-recognition-using-CV


Our prototype is an assistive application for visually impaired in workplace. Based on our initial study of literature, we came across several significant problems a visually impaired person faces in his/her environment, especially in workplace every day. Two of the most common problems were to identify people who are new in the workplace and the awkwardness experienced when the visually impaired person responds to another person who did not intend to address the visually impaired person. Our prototype resolves these two issues. It has a Mobile application to control the camera and a bone conduction device to give clear and concise audio feedback to the user who is visually impaired. The user clicks the button in the mobile application whenever he needs to capture the image of a person to be identified. The application will send the audio feedback through the bone conduction device with details of the person if the person is identified or an appropriate message otherwise. Thus, addressing the first problem of identifying a person of interest (POI). Our application also performs activity recognition if a person is using his phone and addresses the second problem of experiencing awkward situations.
